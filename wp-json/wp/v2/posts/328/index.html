The sand is your bed and your gear is safely stored on your BanksBoard. We woke up to a beautiful and peaceful morning on the beach, we had breakfast packed up pretty quickly and got in the water as we were prepared to swim to fire beach (longest leg). The weirdest thing happened though &#8211; once we got in the water we realized that the current was headed very strongly in the wrong direction which pretty much made it completely impossible for us to make very much progress. As a matter of fact, in half an hour swimming we barely made it across the underwater lava field. We decided that there was no way we are going to be able to trudge through 10 miles with this current so we went back to the same cave we had holed up in the night before. This turned out to be fortuitous since Samantha ended up having to hike out for an interview and Jess and I were able to make the hike to the Kapi\u2019he falls which are an imposing and majestic place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the trail had just opened the day before, the trail to the falls was overgrown and challenging to navigate. It was well worth the bushwhacking though. The falls are nestled deep up the valley, a 3\/4 crescent of several hundred feet lava cliffs that encircle a lush paradise. The falls come down from hundreds of feet above and a curtain of water just rushes down to this beautiful cool pool. The water is so refreshing and great after the strenuous hike. I wish I could better describe the falls as they are breathtakingly beautiful and one of the most spectacular things I\u2019ve ever seen. We swam and filled up our water bottles and pumped water. The water from this fall is the sweetest most delicious water I have ever tasted. The hike out was challenging to say the least, not only did we have to navigate through the sketchy and hard to follow trail but we were lugging about 28 liters of water back to our camp at the beach. Besides each having a full backpack with about 10 liters we shared another backpack that we would wear on our front side that contained the remaining 8 liters. This ended up being a royal pain &#8211; we dubbed this anchor \u2018the bad baby\u2019 and dreaded every step with her. Needless to say, we finally made it out of the valley and slept soundly at our beach encampment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What a way to tour the coast, you just swim and pull out when you tire.
